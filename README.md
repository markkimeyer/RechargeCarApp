## Functionality
### Description
 Recharge is intended to be a user-friendly webpage that accepts location data and returns the nearest smart car charging stations as well as directions to those locations. This app:
 * Takes in the user's location through a series of inputs.
 * Sends that information to the Radar API, which in turn geocodes and sends information to the Open Charger Map API.
 * The information from Open Charger Map is rendered to the page. The name, address, website, phone number, comments, and access are returned for the first five closest locations.
 * The user can click on an location to then have directions to the nearest station rendered to the map.
 * User can clear the map or start over at the click of a button.
